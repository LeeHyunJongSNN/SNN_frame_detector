# SNN_frame_detector
These files are Wi-Fi frame detectors using Spiking Neural Networks with memristive synapses.
The Python files demand BindsNET to operate.
Furthermor, they require our add-on packages to apply memristive synapses for weight updates.
Please install BindsNET and use our detector files.
If you need the package and more datasets, please contact me.
